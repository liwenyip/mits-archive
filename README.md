# Historical Archives of Mount Isa Theatrical Society

This is an archive of stuff to do with Mount Isa Theatrical Society:

- Show Posters/Flyers
- Show Programmes
- Newspaper Clippings
- Cast Photos
- Scans of the comments book
- Other random stuff

It's fairly complete for the years I was publicity offer (2007, 2008, 2009) - the only thing missing is the Programme for Nth Degree Reality.

I also have lots of other documents that aren't suitable for putting on the public internet, e.g. MITS newsletters (contains people's birthdays), committee minutes/reports, accounting records, etc. I can send these on request.

If you have any documents you want to add, email me [my name with no punctuation or spaces]@gmail.com, or create a GitHub account and fork this repository.
