    <td height="308" colspan="2"><p>Laughter, excitement, tears oh, and of course a lot of V-a-g-i-n-a talk. This production has it all! Featuring local actors, musicians, dance and a visual art exhibition.<br>
      <br>
      The V Monologues were written by Eve Ensler after she interviewed over 200 women on their v-a-g-i-n-a-s. All the stories in the play are from real women. Eve Ensler wants to liberate women to talk about female sexuality and raise awareness of violence against women. The Vagina Monologues premiered in 1996 and has received an Obie Award (Off-Broadway Theatre Award, most prestigious award in the US next to the Tony Awards) and now for the first time it will be performed in Mount Isa! </p>
      <p><strong>Did you know? - </strong>the V Monologues have been performed all over the world by actresses such as: Glen Close, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Whoopi Goldberg, Calista Flockhart, Oprah Winfrey, Jane Fonda, Winona Ryder, Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Alanis Morissette, Claire Danes, Cate Blanchett, and Tara Moss.</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>In most reviews the Vagina Monologues has been described as outrageously funny and hilarious! </strong></p>
    <p>So get your friends together (males allowed!), get someone to look after your children for an evening and get some tickets to this great show!<br>
