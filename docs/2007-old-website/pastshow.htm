      <p><strong>First Production of 2006 <br>
      </strong><strong>&quot;But Why Bump Off Barnaby?&quot;</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">With Harlequins' director Jose Cobos taking up the title role, and several seasoned farce actors filling the others, this play kicked off another successful year for the MITS group. As a comdey/farce murder mystery, it was well recieved by audiences. With visual effects such as disappearing glow-in-the-dark poison, the play kept audiences on their toes and even engaged them in 'solving the mystery'.</p>

&quot;Breaker Morant&quot; </strong></p>
    <p align="justify">This classic Australian tale about the soldier Breaker Morant in the Boer War was a major hit, and not just because of the entire male cast being in unifrom! Directed by Sue Windle, and starring local ABC radio presenter Scott Barrett as Breaker, this production drew many local male residents into the MITS community. This production was also performed in neighbouring Cloncurry.</p></td>

      &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">Adapted from Terry Pratcher's Discworld series, Wyrd Sisters is centered around three witches; Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick, and the colourful characters that they encounter. Armed with various spells and a confusing moral code, these three spend the duration of the play fighting to protect their kingdom from the inept Duke and his domineering wife. Directed by Jose Cobos and with flamboyant costumes and sets, this play was hilarious with both its dry wit and poltical commentary entertaining both Discworld-fans and general audiences alike.</p></td>

    </strong><strong>&quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; </strong></p>
      <p align="justify">To celebrate MITS Jubilee year, the group perfromed this classic play by William Shakespeare with a Mount Isa twist. With many of the characters assuming the roles of Mount Isa Mines employees, the audience was entertained on many levels. Being the first out-doors production, the set building task was huge and a non-local director was recruited to help the proceedings along. This production was a bold move for the group but never-the-less proved highly successful. </p>

      &quot;A Knight to Remember&quot;</strong></p>
      <div align="justify">Another success in the 2005 production program of MITS. This play featured many a quirky character inluding a wicked witch and her minions (like the grotesque Dingbat), a minstrel and his groupies, a princess, a wizard, his clumsy sister and knight. Directed by Jason Catling (President of MITS in 2005), this incorporated warped renditions of popular songs such as ACDC's Long Way to the Top and delightful costuming. All in all, A Knight to Remember continued MITS' tradition of audience-loving melodrama. . </div></td>
