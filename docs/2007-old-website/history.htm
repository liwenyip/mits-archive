    <td colspan="2"><p class="style8">The History of MITS</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style7">The Mount Isa Theatrical Society sprang out of a group known as the &ldquo;MICEGS&rdquo; Mount Isa Cultural and Entertainment Group which was formed in 1955, although its true origins probably lay in the BSD Players who produced a children&rsquo;s play &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; in 1954 for the Mount Isa Mines Christmas Party. Well that is what I have been told and read about the formation of MITS but on further investigation I found this piece of information as well. Quote from a newspaper article found amongst old treasures &lsquo;The society which developed from an October 1951 production of a variety show by the Presbyterian Friendship Association and the 1952 Mount Isa Light Opera Company&rdquo;. Which ever way you look at it the society has well and truly reached its Golden Jubilee. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style7"> Over the years we have presented a wide variety of plays such as George Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arms and the Man&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pygmalion&rdquo;, Pinter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birthday Party&rdquo; and so on. In the early days musicals have also been successful with productions of &ldquo;South Pacific&rdquo; and &ldquo;Merry Widow&rdquo; just to name a couple. When the second North Queensland Games were held in 1986 MITS presented the Pioneers Pageant as part of the opening ceremony, this was not only a triumph for MITS but for Mount Isa as well. In later years more Australian plays have been performed, as have a variety of thought provoking plays, MITS member Yvonne Bulfin translated &ldquo;Stanislavski&rsquo;s Chair&rdquo; from Dutch and it has been performed twice in different forms. The most recent was the uncensored version; it was a very confronting play that made audiences squirm in their seats. The tried and true comedy/farce is always popular as is the traditional melodrama and we try to keep a lot of these in the program.<br>

      <p class="style7">In the 1970&rsquo;s Theatre Restaurant was introduced and stayed as a popular format, even with &ldquo;straight plays&rdquo; (sic). A night at MITS is complete night out with a two course dinner and a licensed bar in operation. Each year up until the late seventies the Central Western Drama Festival was held with participants from Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, and Julia Creek. </p>
      <p class="style7">The society owes much to MIM for supplying a club room and rehearsal hall since its formation; however in 1971 the company needed the buildings for its own purposes. Land was obtained from the council by way of a recreational lease and three old class rooms from the Mineside School were purchased from the Department of Works for $70.00. They were moved to the present site during Christmas 1972 and throughout 1973 renovations were made. <br>

    <td height="222" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="style7">The present stage and basement were added to the building in 1978. This was a huge undertaking for the club and MIM being the major employer in the town assisted with all manner of projects, technical expertise, loaned equipment just to mention a few. Many of our members have worked or still work for Xstrata (Mount Isa Mines) to my knowledge we still have two life members of MITS working for the company Vic Stampton and Anita Hastie. The society&rsquo;s Patron, Sir George Fisher is further testament to the connections to MIM. </p>
        <p align="justify" class="style7">The society&rsquo;s fortunes have fluctuated along with the town and although we are few in number the aims and ideals are still the same, to provide good quality live theatre to our audiences and to foster and encourage the talents of anyone interested in theatre. MITS also assists local schools, sporting clubs and worthy causes with fundraising pre-sold nights where the fundraiser retains a portion of the ticket sales. Fifty years on in Mount Isa is a great milestone when you know that the Queensland Theatre Company is only 25 years old. Former members have gone on to bigger and better things with a couple of NIDA graduates having emerged from our humble beginnings. </p></td>
